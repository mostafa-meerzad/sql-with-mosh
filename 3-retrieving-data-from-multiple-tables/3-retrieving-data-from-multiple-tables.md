# Joins

## 1. **What is a JOIN?**

A JOIN combines rows from two or more tables based on a related column.
Think of it like:
üëâ Table A = ‚ÄúUsers‚Äù (who they are)
üëâ Table B = ‚ÄúOrders‚Äù (what they bought)
üëâ JOIN them = ‚ÄúWhich user bought what‚Äù

**Note**: in MySQL you can just type `JOIN` or `INNER JOIN` it works the same way, the `INNER` word is optional.

**Syntax**:

```sql
SELECT *  "your columns selection"
FROM table_1   "the first table you want to combine columns"
JOIN table_2    "the second table you want to combine columns with"
ON  condition    "the condition that you want to join columns based on "

```

## 2. **INNER JOIN**

An **INNER JOIN** returns only the rows that have a **match in both tables**.
If there‚Äôs no match, that row is excluded.

### Example

Suppose we have these tables:

**Users Table**

| user_id | name    | country |
| ------- | ------- | ------- |
| 1       | Alice   | USA     |
| 2       | Bob     | Canada  |
| 3       | Charlie | UK      |

**Orders Table**

| order_id | user_id | product  |
| -------- | ------- | -------- |
| 101      | 1       | Laptop   |
| 102      | 2       | Phone    |
| 103      | 2       | Keyboard |
| 104      | 4       | Mouse    |

### Query with INNER JOIN

```sql
SELECT users.user_id, users.name, orders.product
FROM users
INNER JOIN orders
    ON users.user_id = orders.user_id;
```

üëâ Result:

| user_id | name  | product  |
| ------- | ----- | -------- |
| 1       | Alice | Laptop   |
| 2       | Bob   | Phone    |
| 2       | Bob   | Keyboard |

‚úÖ Explanation:

- Alice (id=1) matched ‚Üí Laptop
- Bob (id=2) matched twice ‚Üí Phone, Keyboard
- Charlie (id=3) had no order ‚Üí excluded
- order with user_id=4 ‚Üí excluded (no matching user)

---

## 3. **Column Name Conflict (same column in both tables)**

Both `users` and `orders` have a column named **`user_id`**.
If you just write:

```sql
SELECT user_id FROM users INNER JOIN orders ...
```

üëâ SQL will complain: **‚ÄúColumn 'user_id' is ambiguous‚Äù**
Because it doesn‚Äôt know if you mean `users.user_id` or `orders.user_id`.

### Solution

Always **prefix with the table (or alias)**:

```sql
SELECT users.user_id, orders.user_id
FROM users
INNER JOIN orders ON users.user_id = orders.user_id;
```

üëâ Or shorter, use aliases:

```sql
SELECT u.user_id AS user_from_users, o.user_id AS user_from_orders
FROM users AS u
INNER JOIN orders AS o
    ON u.user_id = o.user_id;
```

This way you control exactly which `user_id` you want.

---

‚ö° Recap:

- `INNER JOIN` ‚Üí only matching rows
- If same column exists in both tables ‚Üí must prefix with `table.column` or alias

## 4. Using aliases

Use alias to make your join query short and easy to understand:

```sql
SELECT u.user_id, u.name, o.product
FROM users u
JOIN orders o ON u.user_id = o.user_id;

```

```sql
SELECT u.user_id, u.name, o.product
FROM users AS u
JOIN orders AS o ON u.user_id = o.user_id;

```

- AS is optional for table aliases; both styles are fine.

- Prefer aliases in joins to keep the SELECT list tidy and to avoid typos.

## 5. Alternative syntax when the join keys share the same name: USING

```sql
SELECT
  user_id,        -- note: no qualifier now
  u.name,
  o.product
FROM users u
JOIN orders o
USING (user_id);

```

### What changes with USING

- The join key(s) named in USING are coalesced into a single output column called user_id.

- You now refer to it unqualified (user_id).

- Trying to reference u.user_id or o.user_id after USING will usually error, because the output has a single merged user_id.

Tip: USING is neat for common keys, but many teams still prefer ON ... = ... for clarity and portability.

## Importance of ON phrase in JOINs

# 1. What happens if you JOIN with **no `ON` condition**?

If you write:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM users
JOIN orders;
```

(or in some SQL flavors, if you omit `ON` but don‚Äôt use `USING`), what you actually get is a **CROSS JOIN** (also called a **Cartesian product**).

üëâ This means: **every row from `users` is paired with every row from `orders`**.

---

### Example

**Users**

| user_id | name  |
| ------- | ----- |
| 1       | Alice |
| 2       | Bob   |

**Orders**

| order_id | user_id | product  |
| -------- | ------- | -------- |
| 101      | 1       | Laptop   |
| 102      | 2       | Phone    |
| 103      | 2       | Keyboard |

---

### CROSS JOIN result

Without `ON`, SQL pairs **each row from users with every row from orders**:

| user_id | name  | order_id | user_id | product  |
| ------- | ----- | -------- | ------- | -------- |
| 1       | Alice | 101      | 1       | Laptop   |
| 1       | Alice | 102      | 2       | Phone    |
| 1       | Alice | 103      | 2       | Keyboard |
| 2       | Bob   | 101      | 1       | Laptop   |
| 2       | Bob   | 102      | 2       | Phone    |
| 2       | Bob   | 103      | 2       | Keyboard |

- That‚Äôs **2 users √ó 3 orders = 6 rows**.
- In general: if table A has _m_ rows and table B has _n_ rows, a CROSS JOIN gives _m √ó n_ rows.
- Notice that most of these rows **don‚Äôt make sense** (e.g., Bob paired with Alice‚Äôs Laptop order).

This is why **joining with no condition is almost never what you want** (unless you‚Äôre deliberately building a grid of combinations, like all color‚Äìsize pairs).

---

# 2. What happens when you add `ON users.user_id = orders.user_id`?

Now you‚Äôre telling SQL: _‚ÄúDon‚Äôt just pair everything ‚Äî only keep the pairs where the user IDs match.‚Äù_

```sql
SELECT u.user_id, u.name, o.product
FROM users u
JOIN orders o
  ON u.user_id = o.user_id;
```

---

### Step 1 ‚Äî SQL still starts by doing a CROSS JOIN in theory

It considers every possible `(user, order)` pair. (Databases optimize this heavily behind the scenes, but logically, that‚Äôs what happens.)

### Step 2 ‚Äî Apply the `ON` condition

Keep only the pairs where `u.user_id = o.user_id`.

From the big 6-row CROSS JOIN above, only these survive:

| user_id | name  | product  |
| ------- | ----- | -------- |
| 1       | Alice | Laptop   |
| 2       | Bob   | Phone    |
| 2       | Bob   | Keyboard |

‚úÖ This is now an **INNER JOIN result**.

---

# 3. Why is `ON` so important?

- **Without `ON`:** you explode the dataset into meaningless combinations (CROSS JOIN).
- **With `ON`:** you filter down to meaningful matches between rows.

üëâ So you can think of `ON` as the **rule that connects rows between tables**. Without it, there‚Äôs no relationship ‚Äî just chaos.

---

# 4. Bonus: what if the `ON` condition isn‚Äôt equality?

The `ON` doesn‚Äôt _have_ to be `=` ‚Äî it can be any boolean condition:

```sql
JOIN orders o
  ON u.user_id = o.user_id
     AND o.created_at >= DATE '2025-01-01'
```

- This still matches users to their orders, but only keeps **recent** orders.
- Some advanced cases even join on ranges (`u.birthday BETWEEN o.start_date AND o.end_date`), but equality on keys is the norm.

---

‚úÖ **Summary:**

- No `ON` ‚Üí CROSS JOIN (every row with every row).
- With `ON` ‚Üí INNER JOIN (keep only pairs where condition is true).
- Internally, SQL thinks ‚ÄúCROSS JOIN first, then filter by ON.‚Äù

---

## Where could WHERE, ORDER BY, and LIMIT go?

```sql
SELECT u.user_id, u.name, o.product
FROM users u
JOIN orders o ON u.user_id = o.user_id
WHERE o.created_at >= DATE '2025-01-01'   -- filter rows after the join
ORDER BY u.name ASC                        -- sort the final result
LIMIT 100;
```

- Remember the execution order: FROM/JOIN ‚Üí WHERE ‚Üí SELECT ‚Üí ORDER BY ‚Üí LIMIT.

- That‚Äôs why you can use table columns in WHERE, but can‚Äôt use a SELECT-alias there (the alias doesn‚Äôt exist yet).

## Joining Across Databases

To join tables across databases you need to prefix the tables with the name of their database! and only required for the tables that are not in the currently selected database

```sql
SELECT *
FROM order_items AS oi
JOIN sql_inventory.products AS p
  ON oi.product_id = p.product_id

```

## Self Joins

# 1. What is a **Self-Join**?

A **self-join** is when you join a table with itself.

- It‚Äôs the same physical table, but you treat it as if it were **two different tables** by giving each one an **alias**.
- This is useful when rows in a table relate to **other rows in the same table**.

# 2. Example Scenario ‚Äî Employees & Managers

Suppose we have an `employees` table:

| emp_id | name    | manager_id |
| ------ | ------- | ---------- |
| 1      | Alice   | NULL       |
| 2      | Bob     | 1          |
| 3      | Charlie | 1          |
| 4      | David   | 2          |
| 5      | Eve     | 2          |

- `manager_id` points to the `emp_id` of that employee‚Äôs manager.
- Alice (id=1) has `NULL` ‚Üí she‚Äôs the CEO.
- Bob and Charlie report to Alice.
- David and Eve report to Bob.

---

# 3. Query: Show each employee with their manager‚Äôs name

```sql
SELECT e.name AS employee,
       m.name AS manager
FROM employees e
JOIN employees m
  ON e.manager_id = m.emp_id;
```

---

### How it works line by line

1. `FROM employees e` ‚Üí first copy of the table, alias `e` (‚Äúemployees‚Äù).
2. `JOIN employees m` ‚Üí second copy of the _same table_, alias `m` (‚Äúmanagers‚Äù).
3. `ON e.manager_id = m.emp_id` ‚Üí match each employee‚Äôs manager_id to the manager‚Äôs emp_id.
4. `SELECT e.name AS employee, m.name AS manager` ‚Üí pick out the two names, label them clearly.

---

### Result

| employee | manager |
| -------- | ------- |
| Bob      | Alice   |
| Charlie  | Alice   |
| David    | Bob     |
| Eve      | Bob     |

‚úÖ Notice Alice isn‚Äôt listed as an employee because she has no manager (`NULL` didn‚Äôt match anything).

---

# 4. Why aliases are critical in a self-join

If you just wrote `SELECT name` without prefixes, SQL wouldn‚Äôt know whether you mean employee name or manager name ‚Äî both come from the same table.
üëâ That‚Äôs why you **must** use aliases (`e`, `m`) in self-joins.

---

# 5. Other real-life uses of self-joins

- **Hierarchy data**: managers & employees, categories & subcategories.
- **Comparisons within a table**: e.g., find pairs of students from the same city.
- **Detect duplicates**: compare a row against others in the same table.

---

‚úÖ **Summary**

- A **self-join** is just a regular join, but with the _same_ table on both sides.
- Use **aliases** to treat them as two tables.
- Very useful for hierarchical or relational data inside one table.
