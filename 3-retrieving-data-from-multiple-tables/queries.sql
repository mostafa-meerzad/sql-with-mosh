--  ---------- join customers and orders tables where customer has placed an order --------------
SELECT *
FROM customers
INNER JOIN orders

-- ----------- using alias -------------
SELECT c.customer_id, c.first_name, o.order_id
FROM customers  c
JOIN orders  o
ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;


-- -----------what if we join tables with no condition? -------
--  well the result will be a giant table consisting of all the data in all the tables!
--  this is a really poor way of joining tables "Cross Join" which is not useful
--  this giant table would have "m x n" tables "m" being columns of first-table, "n" being columns of second-column:  3 x 2 = 6

SELECT *
FROM customers
INNER JOIN orders;


-- selecting column names that are unique for the tables
SELECT first_name, last_name, order_date, order_id
FROM customers
INNER JOIN orders
ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id ;


-- selecting column names that are present in both tables
SELECT first_name, last_name, order_date, order_id, customer_id
FROM customers
INNER JOIN orders
ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id ;

-- with query above we get an error ``Error: Column 'customer_id' in field list is ambiguous``
-- because the "customer_id" exists on both tables and MySQL gets confused, from which table to select the column!
